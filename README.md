# napisy24-stremio-addon

This addon will provide subtitles for movies & series from portal [Napisy24.pl](http://napisy24.pl) in Polish language

It is based on Napisy24 "_API documentation_" from those two forum posts: [\[1\]](https://forum.napisy24.pl/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=142) [\[2\]](https://forum.napisy24.pl/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=226)

The addon is far from perfect and has its flaws. Napisy24 uses OSDB hashes just like Stremio. If searching by hash brings no results, it will try to search with IMDB id. If that also fails, a text search will be performed

When searching by IMDB id, subtitles will have **Napisy24** prefix and **release info** as name. You will need to always select them manually
